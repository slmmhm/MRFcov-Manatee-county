# MRFcov-Manatee-county
This code was developed for host seeking mosquito data from Manatee county, FL. 
The original code was developed by @Nicholas Clark, and it was modified to estimate the spatial co-occurrence probabilities between spaecies pairs of mosquito species using the spatial spline. Bootstrap analysis was used with 500 replicates and 100% of sampling points and random replacement of data points in each replicate. 
A code for network graphs is also provided to demonstrate the strength and direction or correlations between spaeices pairs.
